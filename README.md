# Multimodal-MedQA

## Overview
This repo contains 25 image-question pairs taken from the medical domain. It is intended to test multimodal capabilities, with the questions prefiltered to be impossible to answer without accurate understanding of visual contents.

## Contents
The .csv file contains the questions, answer choices formated as a list of strings, the correct answer as well as a reference to the image_nr.

## Limitations
The data was manually compiled by me and, while aimed to be representative of data that may be encountered as part of a medical licensing exam, may be inaccurate or outdated. Use is for benchmarking purposes only.
